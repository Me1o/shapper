## hello!
this was made as a solution for the Infinite recursive shape question/challange. 


##things to know:
1-i have used the starter temolate from here:https://github.com/nea/Typescript-Starter to save time configuring/ setting up TS.
2- i have used css to pretify the way the shape looks but left a console log of the array intact(in case you wannted to see the thing raw).
